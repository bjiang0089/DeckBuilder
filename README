Welcome to the DeckBuilder wiki!

DeckBuilder is a personal project to keep up my Java coding skills sharp and to learn how to create web pages. 
This project is being modeled after [Moxfield](https://moxfield.com), an online deck building website for Magic the Gathering.

From the root of the project, run the following on the command line to run the example
 `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=APITutorial`

Search function has been updated to allow for advanced search syntax like oracle searching with regex.
